This is what the information on a new ticket would look like. Tickets would be written by end-users who are having issues or by admins on behalf of users. When a new ticket comes in administrators might assign a ticket to a specific agent as well as a SLA(depending on the issue). 
  Agents assigned can stay in contact with user who made the ticket, keeping them updated as they work to resolve the issue. Tickets can also be assigned to entire departments as well as specific teams. when a ticket is resolved the user can be contacted and the ticket can now be listed as resolved, closing the ticket.
